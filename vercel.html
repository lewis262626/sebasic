            It's been over a year since I bought a new domain and redesigned my blog. I wrote a post about Medium and why I decided to stop writing there. I was planning to write about many things, I set up a nice Markdown editor on my Mac, everything was ready to go. Then I did nothing, for a year. ðŸ˜´

During this lockdown, I felt the urge to do it all over again but I successfully resisted it. Then I caved in one evening and rebuilt everything. This time it's much simpler and I'm much more pleased with the tech stack.
